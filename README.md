## 📌 Project Summary 

This project presents an exploratory data analysis of global temperature anomaly trends from 1961 to 2022 using publicly available climate data from Kaggle. The goal of the study is to quantify long-term changes in temperature across countries, identify regional warming patterns, and visualize the magnitude of climate change over the past six decades.

Using a combination of data cleaning, feature engineering, and statistical summarization techniques, the analysis derives multiple measures of temperature change—including first-to-last recorded values, minimum-to-maximum ranges, and comparative averages of early versus recent years. These metrics are visualized through line charts and choropleth maps to illustrate both temporal trends and geographic disparities in warming.

The dataset, while comprehensive, contains substantial missing values for certain countries, and results are interpreted with these limitations in mind. Validation against authoritative scientific sources (NASA, UN, IPCC) confirms that the dataset’s observed warming patterns align with globally documented climate trends.
